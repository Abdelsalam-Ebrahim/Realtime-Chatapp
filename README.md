# Real-Time Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built using React and Firebase. The app features user sign-up and sign-in, allowing users to create accounts and log in using a custom authentication method with Firebase. Users can send messages to others, add new users to their contact lists, and search for specific users within the app. All messages and user data are securely stored and managed in Firebase Firestore, providing real-time updates for an interactive experience.
